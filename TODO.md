# Agent Status Transition Issue

## Current Behavior
- Agent status in the UI remains in active state ("Researching", "Writing", "Editing") even after tasks are completed
- The backend logs show correct status transitions and "Done" states being sent
- The UI is not updating to reflect these state changes

## Debug Information
- Backend correctly sends status updates with proper format:
  ```json
  {
    "agent_state": {
      "name": "Research Agent",
      "status": "Done",
      "role": "Research Agent"
    }
  }
  ```
- Status transitions attempted:
  1. Initial state -> Active state (e.g., "Researching") [Working]
  2. Active state -> "Done" [Not Working]

## Attempted Solutions
1. Added explicit status field in messages
2. Normalized status values consistently
3. Simplified status handling in send_status_update
4. Ensured capitalization of status values

## Next Steps
1. Debug the UI's state management (App.js) to understand why it's not updating agent states
2. Verify WebSocket message handling in the frontend
3. Add more detailed logging of state transitions in the UI
4. Consider implementing a state machine for more predictable transitions
